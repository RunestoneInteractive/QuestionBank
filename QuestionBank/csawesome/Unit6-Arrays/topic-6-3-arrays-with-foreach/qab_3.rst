   :feedback_a: This would be true if the loop started at the end of the array and moved toward the beginning.  But, it will loop from the first element to the last.
   :feedback_b: This would be true if temp was only set to the result of checking if the current element in the array is equal to <i>target</i> when it is <i>false</i>.  But, it is reset each time through the loop.
   :feedback_c: The variable <i>temp</i> is assigned to the result of checking if the current element in the array is equal to <i>target</i>.  The last time through the loop it will check if the last element is equal to <i>val</i>.
   :feedback_d: There is no count of the number of times the array element is equal to <i>target</i>.

   Given that ``array`` is an array of integers and ``target`` is an integer value, which of the following best describes the conditions under which the following code segment will return true?
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
     boolean temp = false;
     for (int val : array)
     {
       temp = ( target == val );
     }
     return temp;
